# Keres [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elegal-ev/Keres.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elegal-ev/Keres)

A library for automatic generation of cease and desist ðŸ—Ž based on docx templates

## Getting Started

Keres is still active in development, therefore we don't have a maven central repository.

### Prerequisites for development build

You basically just need an new jdk, we just support jdk11+

Ubuntu:
```
apt-get update && apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
```
Windows: (with choco)
```
choco install openjdk --version 11.0
```

### Installing

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/elegal-ev/Keres.git
```
Build it (here for linux, gradlew.bat for windows)
```
./gradlew jar
```
The jar is located at `build/libs/`

## Running the tests

Just run
```
./gradlew check
```
which is basically a wrapper around `./gradlew test` with a few more checks see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50105980).

## Built With
